I am a clinical psychologist providing accessible, creative and evidence-based assessment and therapy in London. I specialise in working with children, adolescents and families experiencing emotional, behavioural and mental health difficulties.

I use therapeutic approaches that are supported by research evidence and psychological theory. I have training and experience in cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy, and narrative, attachment and psychodynamic interventions.

## Qualifications and experience

I am Chartered with the British Psychological Society (BPS) and Registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).

I completed my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology at University College London. Before this, I studied Psychology and Child Development at the University of London's Institute of Education.

I currently work in an NHS child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) in London. Since 2006, my NHS roles include CAMHS in East Anglia, inpatient settings, adult mental health and clinical research.
